        the things I learned from the reading this week is:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>
            We remember how to create a template for a HTML
        </li>
        <li>
            We review what every tag does and how they work so the web page could be displayed. 
        </li>
        <li>I learned how connect javascript and html. Along with that we make some buttons so 
            they display message in the page.</li>
        <li>
            Use CSS to make the page looking better
        </li>
        <li>
            We should start creating mobile view first and then continue to larger views
        </li>
    </ul>
