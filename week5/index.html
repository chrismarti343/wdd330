    <h1> Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <h2> Debugging is a way to identify and deal with errors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <h3>Errors, Exceptions and Warning </h3> </li>
        <p>The programmer should design in a way that prevents the user 
            from making the error</p>
        
        <li> This are some common error regarding methods and functions: </li>
        <img src="10.png" alt="">
        <p>They can be found and corrected:</p>
        <img src="11.png" alt="">
        
        <li><h3>Stric Mode</h3> </li>
        <p> This mode can helps us to improve its clarity and speed.</p>
        <p> When a variable is undeclared, using strict mode can help us 
            to get an exception instead of a warning.
        </p>

        <li> <h3> Feature Detection </h3></li>
        <p> This method help us to check whether a method o function exits before 
            trying to call them
        </p>

        <li> <h3> Debugging in the Browser </h3></li>
        <p> Creating break point help us to know where the bug or problem 
            is placed and there are some
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            <h3>The Trusty Alert</h3>
            <p> The most basic debugging method is using alert() method, because alert()
                stops the program until the user click on OK button </p>
            
            <P> Equality sign is "==="</P>
            <p> Assigning a value to a variable "="</p>
        
        <li><h3> Using Console</h3></li>
        <p> We have already seen this before: </p>
        <p> console.log() </p>
        <P> The only issue with this method is that it will not actually stop the execution of the program
            in the same way as alert()
        </P>
        </li></ul>

        <li><h3>Error Objects</h3></li>
        <p> Using a constuctor function, we can create an error object created by the host environment</p>

        <p></p>

        <li> <h3>Throwing Exceptions</h3></li>
        <p> When an error occurs, javascript throw an error exception.
            It is posible to throw our own exception with this method
        </p>
